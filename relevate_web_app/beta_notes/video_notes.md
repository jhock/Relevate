# Contributor Notes

### Contributor 10 (Jason Whiting)
- [ ] Institution unclear, user assumed that is where they got the degree from?
	- [ ] Is this desired?
- [ ] User missed the zip code box
	- [ ] Then filled it out once he was redirected to the same page
		- [ ] Maybe saw the message?
- [ ] Why can't you right-click and paste inside the CKEditor box?
- [ ] User clicked my profile when looking for contributor profile.

### Contributor 16 (Cole Ratcliffe)
- [ ] Requested the menu be more noticable/explicit
- [ ] Menu bar is apparently unclear
- [ ] Both users have been unsure of how many topics to select. 
	- [ ] Blurb saying as many as you want or whatever
- [ ] Submitting research is unclear, need to rename "Contributor" tab to something
like "Research"
- [ ] Updating profile is unintuitive, user tried to edit the view directly
- [x] ~~Mentor option displayed on the update page~~
- [?] Topics buttons were not filtered on the update page
	- __Seems to work on my end__
- [ ] User requested functionality to upload a document instead of typing it into
the text box for articles
- [ ] User requests organizing topic selection, either by type or alphabetically

### Contributor 7 (Kimberly Allen)
- [x] ~~Plugin for cv seems to be broken. User probably submitted a file that was not 
a PDF, need to restrict uploads to PDF only~~
	- [x] ~~User uploaded a .docx file~~
	* __Restricted upload type to only .pdf (kinda)__
- [x] ~~On update, if user has a file uploaded, it doesn't display that it's already 
uploaded~~
- [x] ~~Picture does not display on update either~~
- [ ] User requested topic of Family Education/Family Life Coaching
